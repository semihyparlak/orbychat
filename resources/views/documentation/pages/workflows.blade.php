<p>
    Workflows let you script how an agent responds to common visitor
    questions <em>before</em> the LLM is involved. Useful for canned
    answers (refund FAQ, hours, store policies), lead-qualifying
    questionnaires, branching qualification flows, and direct human
    handoff on specific keywords.
</p>

<h2>How it fits</h2>

<p>
    Every visitor message runs through this pipeline:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Curated answer match — admin-pinned exact-question answer.</li>
    <li><strong>Workflow match</strong> â† this page.</li>
    <li>RAG retrieval + LLM generation.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    A workflow short-circuits the LLM call when it matches: the
    visitor receives the scripted bubbles, no token cost is incurred,
    and the conversation is tagged with the workflow run for analytics.
</p>

<h2>How a workflow connects to an agent</h2>

<p>
    A workflow only fires for a visitor turn when <strong>three</strong>
    conditions all line up:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Status</strong> is <code>active</code>. New workflows
        start in <code>draft</code> and the runtime ignores them
        entirely until you flip the status — that's how you stage
        edits without breaking live traffic. <code>disabled</code>
        is a third state for "paused but not deleted".
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Agent scope</strong> matches. On the workflow's
        edit page, the <em>Scoped to agent</em> select gives you
        two shapes:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Workspace-wide (every agent)</strong> —
                <code>agent_id IS NULL</code>. The workflow is
                eligible for every agent in your workspace. Good for
                cross-cutting flows like "the word 'human' anywhere
                triggers handoff".
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pinned to one agent</strong> — pick a
                specific agent from the dropdown. The workflow is
                eligible only for conversations on that agent. Good
                for shop-specific FAQ ("returns" only matters on the
                Shopify-store agent, not on the docs agent).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Trigger fires</strong>. The visitor's message has
        to actually match the workflow's keyword set (under the
        configured <code>any</code> / <code>all</code> /
        <code>exact</code> match mode).
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Concretely, for every visitor turn the engine runs one query:
</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM workflows
 WHERE status = 'active'
   AND workspace_id = :current_workspace
   AND (agent_id IS NULL OR agent_id = :current_agent)</code></pre>

<p>
    …and walks the matching rows in order, returning the first whose
    keywords match the message. Order is the
    insertion order from the database (i.e. older workflows
    win ties); use status <code>disabled</code> to deactivate a
    workflow without losing its keywords. There's no priority
    column today — if you need stricter precedence, narrow the
    keyword sets so two workflows can't both match the same turn.
</p>

<h3>Quick recipe — wire a fresh workflow to an agent</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Go to <code>/app/workflows</code> â†’ <strong>New workflow</strong>.</li>
    <li>
        Give it a name. Pick the agent from <em>Scoped to agent</em>
        (or leave on <em>Workspace-wide</em>).
    </li>
    <li>
        Status: pick <strong>Active</strong> if you're ready to ship it
        immediately, or <strong>Draft</strong> while you're still
        editing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add at least one keyword in the trigger config (e.g.
        <code>refund</code>) and pick a match mode.
    </li>
    <li>Add at least one step — a <code>message</code> bubble works.</li>
    <li>Save.</li>
    <li>
        On the targeted agent's public widget, type a message
        containing the keyword. The workflow runs instead of the LLM,
        and you'll see the scripted reply.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    To stop a workflow without deleting it, flip its status to
    <code>disabled</code>. To re-target it from one agent to another,
    just change <em>Scoped to agent</em> on the same workflow row —
    no need to clone the steps.
</p>

<h2>Capabilities</h2>

<ul>
    <li>One trigger type: <strong>on keyword</strong>, with three match modes (any / all / exact).</li>
    <li>Six step types: <strong>message</strong>, <strong>question</strong>, <strong>branch</strong>, <strong>tag_lead</strong>, <strong>webhook</strong>, <strong>escalate</strong>.</li>
    <li>Variable interpolation: <strong>@{{var_name}}</strong> in any message text resolves the captured value at runtime.</li>
    <li>Conditional branching on captured answers (5 match operators + a default fallback).</li>
    <li>Side-effect steps for tagging leads and POSTing to external webhooks (queued, fire-and-forget).</li>
</ul>

    <thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>What it does</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>message</code></td>
            <td>Send one chat bubble. Supports <code>@{{var_name}}</code> interpolation. Walks straight to the next step.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>question</code></td>
            <td>Send one bubble + pause the run. The visitor's next message is captured into <code>var_name</code> and the run resumes from the next step on the following turn.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>branch</code></td>
            <td>Evaluate <code>vars[var]</code> against an ordered list of cases and jump to the first matching <code>go_to</code> step index. The case operators are <code>equals</code>, <code>contains</code>, <code>starts_with</code>, <code>is_empty</code>, <code>not_empty</code>, and <code>default</code> (a fallback fired when no other case hits).

            <td>Append string tags to the conversation's Lead row (creates a stub Lead if the visitor hasn't submitted the inline form yet). Tags accumulate and dedupe on <code>fields.tags</code>.

            <td>Fire-and-forget POST (or GET) to an external URL with the run's <code>vars</code>, <code>conversation_id</code>, <code>workflow_id</code>, and any <code>extra_payload</code>.

    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Trigger match modes</h2>

<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Mode</th><th>Matches when</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>any</code> <em>(default)</em></td>
            <td>At least one keyword appears as a case-insensitive substring of the visitor's message. <code>"pricing"</code> matches "tell me about pricing please".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>all</code></td>
            <td>Every keyword must appear as a substring. Useful for compound qualifiers — <code>["enterprise", "security"]</code> won't fire on "tell me about pricing", but will on "enterprise security review".</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>exact</code></td>
            <td>The trimmed lower-cased message equals one of the keywords verbatim. Use for single-word commands ("cancel", "help", "support") that need to NOT fire on substring matches.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Branch routing</h2>

<p>
    A <code>branch</code> step's <code>cases</code> array is walked in
    order. The first case whose <code>match</code> evaluates true wins,
    and execution jumps to <code>go_to</code> (a step index).
    <code>match: default</code> is a special case that always matches
    and should sit last — it's the catch-all when none of the
    preceding operators fire.
</p>

<pre><code>{
  "type": "branch",
  "var": "plan_interest",
  "cases": [
    { "match": "equals",      "value": "free", "go_to": 5 },
    { "match": "contains",    "value": "pro",  "go_to": 8 },
    { "match": "not_empty",                    "go_to": 12 },
    { "match": "default",                      "go_to": 15 }
  ]
}</code></pre>

<p>
    A flow can chain branches — the loop-guard caps execution at 32
    jumps per turn so two branches accidentally pointing at each other
    can't infinite-loop. When the guard trips the run is marked
    <code>failed</code> and whatever bubbles were emitted before the
    loop are still flushed to the visitor.
</p>

<h2>Trigger semantics</h2>

<p>
    The runtime walks every <strong>active</strong> workflow whose
    workspace matches the conversation's agent and whose
    <code>agent_id</code> is either NULL (workspace-wide) or matches
    the conversation's agent. Within those rows, the first workflow
    whose keywords match (per its <code>match_mode</code>) wins.
    Order on the index page is by <code>updated_at</code>
    descending — most-recently-saved workflows are tried first.
</p>

<h2>Editing — visual canvas (default) and linear form (alt)</h2>

<p>
    Two ways to edit a workflow, both backed by the same JSON shape:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Visual canvas</strong> at <code>/app/workflows/{id}/canvas</code>
        — the <strong>default</strong> editor. Clicking a workflow on
        the index page or saving a freshly-created flow lands you
        here. React-Flow editor with one node per step, draggable
        connections between handles, and a right-side inspector
        panel. Branch nodes have one handle per case (plus an optional
        <code>default</code> handle); wire each handle to the next step.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Linear form</strong> at <code>/app/workflows/{id}/edit</code>
        — the alternate. A stack of step cards with type-specific
        fields. Reach it from the canvas page's "Linear edit" button
        when a flow is simple enough that a flat list reads cleaner
        than a graph.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The canvas persists the visual layout (node positions + edge
    connections) under <code>definition.canvas</code>, alongside the
    runtime-consumed <code>definition.steps</code> array — so flows
    authored in the canvas re-open with the same arrangement next time.
</p>

<p>
    Saving from the canvas runs a topological walk of the graph from
    the trigger node and serialises the steps array in BFS order.
    Branch <code>cases[*].go_to</code> are populated from the edge
    target indices, so re-saving a flow you only opened to read
    leaves the steps unchanged.
</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Draft</strong> — never matched. Use this while editing.</li>
    <li><strong>Active</strong> — matched on every visitor turn.</li>
    <li><strong>Disabled</strong> — kept for history but never matched. Useful for seasonal flows you'll re-enable later.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Phase 3 outlook</h2>

<p>
    The persistence shape stays forwards-compatible. Phase 3 will likely add:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>A/B testing — multiple workflow variants share a trigger; the runtime picks one per visitor and records which one converted.</li>
    <li>Per-flow analytics — drop-off rates per step, branch-arm distributions, time-to-handoff.</li>
    <li>Visitor-segment triggers (in addition to keywords) — page URL pattern, returning vs new, GeoIP.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Older runtimes reading a Phase-3 definition will silently skip
    step types they don't recognise, so a future admin can save a
    definition that gracefully degrades on an older deployment.
</p>
