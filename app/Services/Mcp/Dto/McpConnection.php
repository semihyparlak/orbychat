 * Resolved connection details for one MCP server call. Produced by

 *
 * The DTO carries the already-assembled auth header rather than the
 * raw API key / OAuth token — this is the seam that keeps decrypted
 * credentials out of every code path except McpCredentialResolver.
 * Tests can construct this directly without going through the
 * resolver.
 *
 * Octane safety: the McpClient never holds onto a connection between
 * requests; one DTO per call, garbage-collected at the end.
