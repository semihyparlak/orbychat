 * The raw `sources.error` column stays untouched for operator log-spelunking
 * (rendered behind a "Show details" toggle, included in support reports).
 * This presenter only governs the headline string we surface in the UI:
 * no API keys, no upstream HTTP bodies, no provider names — just a short
 * actionable line the customer can read without filing a ticket.
 *
 * The matching is best-effort. Anything we don't have a rule for falls
 * back to a generic "Couldn't reach this page." line — better to under-
 * communicate than leak a stack trace.
